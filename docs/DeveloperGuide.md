## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CompanyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Company` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `InternBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a company).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InternBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Company` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Company>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `InternBook`, which `Company` references. This allows `InternBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Company` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Setting Reminder

#### Implementation
The reminder feature is supported by the `Reminder` class, which is associated with the `Days` and `ReminderOnOff` class.
`Reminder` class keeps track of two values which are `days` and `reminderOnOff`.
* `days` - A `Days` type that keeps track of the number of days, the user input, from the end date of an application.
* `reminderOnOff` - A `ReminderOnOff` type that keeps track whether the reminder feature is on or off.

`Reminder` implements the following relevant methods:
* `Reminder(Days days, ReminderOnOff reminderOnOff)` - Constructor for reminder with days and reminderOnOff specified.
* `getDays()` - Gets the number of days before the deadline to trigger the reminder.
* `getReminderOnOff` - Gets the status of the reminder.

An example usage scenario for setting reminder is as follows:
Step 1: The user launches the application and the `Ui` loads up.
Step 2: The user inputs a command to set reminder using the `reminder` command.
Step 3: The `LogicManager` takes the user input and parses it using `SetReminderParser`, which in turn creates a `SetReminderCommand`.
object.
Step 4: `SetReminderCommand#execute` is called,  which keeps track of the `reminder` passed into the constructor.
Step 5: The `Model` saves the user's input into a json file.

The sequence diagram below shows how the `reminder` command works within the `Logic` component.

<puml src="diagrams/ReminderSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The activity diagram below summarizes the process of setting a reminder:

<puml src="diagrams/ReminderActivityDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Design considerations:

1. **Error Handling**

   * Ensure robust error handling to gracefully manage exceptions and failures during command execution.
   * Utilise the `CommandException` class to handle and propagate errors consistently.

2. **Input Validation:**
   * Validate user input to ensure it meets the expected format and constraints.
   * Verify that the number of days provided is a valid integer and within an acceptable range.

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   * Separate the parsing of user input from the execution logic to improve code.
   * Consider creating a dedicated parser class responsible for converting user input into a `Reminder` object.

4. **Storing of User's Input**
   * Storing user's preference for reminder feature into a json file.
   * Preference is saved for future usage.


### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated in two parts, the first by the `FindCommandParser`, and then the `FindCommand`

Given below is a step-by-step detailed guide on how the find mechanism works.

Step 1. The user launches the application. This does not affect anything in the find command pathway.

Step 2. The user executes `find ABC` command in order to find all entries matching the name or tag ABC.

Step 3. The `FindCommandParser` parses the information directly to identify the keyword to be found.

Displayed in the diagram below is how the `FindCommandParser` interacts while parsing the information.

<puml src="diagrams/FindParserClass.puml" alt="Interactions of FindCommandParser while parsing information" />

Step 4. A `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` object is created, which inherits `Predicate<Company>` and overrides a `Test` method which determines whether a certain company is a match.

Step 5. A `FindCommand` instance is created, initializing the `NameContainsKeywordPredicate` as relevant.

Step 6. The `FindCommand` goes through its execution cycle, facilitated by `Model`

Step 7. The `Model` filters the Company List based on the predicate, and returns the filtered list.

The sequence diagram below traces the pathway of the find command within the `Logic` component, taking `find ABC` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find ABC` Command" />


### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated in two parts, the first by the `EditCommandParser`, and then the `EditCommand`

Given below is a step-by-step detailed guide on how the edit mechanism works.

Step 1. The user launches the application. This does not affect anything in the edit command pathway.

Step 2. The user executes `edit 1 -n ABC` command in order to edit the name in the first index.

Step 3. The `EditCommandParser` parses the information through `ParserUtil` in the command to identify each component.

Displayed in the diagram below is how the `EditCommandParser` interacts while parsing the information.

<puml src="diagrams/EditParserClass.puml" alt="Interactions of EditCommandParser while parsing information" />

Step 4. This information is encapsulated inside an `editCompanyDescriptor`, which contains all the values associated with the changed prefixes. In this case, it will set the name of the descriptor to `ABC`.

Step 5. An `EditCommand` instance is created, initializing the `index` and `editCompanyDescriptor` as relevant.

Step 6. The `EditCommand` goes through its execution cycle, facilitated by `Model`

Step 7. The `Model` retrieves the Company List, and sets the edited company described in the `editCompanyDescriptor` to the company at index `index`.

The sequence diagram below traces the pathway of the edit command within the `Logic` component, taking `edit 1 -n ABC` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit 1 -n ABC` Command" />

### Application `date` property

#### Implementation

The date property enables users to keep track of application start and end dates. End dates must be the same or later than start dates.

The implementation of this property is similar to the other properties present in the company entity. The difference lies in the link between start and end dates. 

Below are some of the design choices made, as well as alternative implementations possible.

#### Design choices
1. Start and end dates are represented with the same type.\
The company entity contains 2 date entities for start and end dates.
<puml src="diagrams/CompanyObjectDiagram.puml" alt="Object diagram representing the date property in company" /> 
The following alternative implementations explored:
    * Have a date range class that represents both the start and end date
      * Pros: Easier checking of constraints that apply on both the start and end date
      * Cons: Low extensibility. Potentially high coupling between company and date property.

2. [!IMPORTANT] Checks on constraints that apply to both start and end dates are handled outside the company class, at the point of Date object creation.
    Since the company constructor does not currently throw any exceptions, it would require a huge refactor to enable constraint checks within the constructor.\
**Hence, the responsibility lies on the caller to check that the start and end dates provided to the company are correct.**

<puml src="diagrams/AddDateCheckSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence diagram for date checks in Add Command" />

The above diagram shows that the checks are called by the AddCommandParser object.

<puml src="diagrams/EditDateCheckSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence diagram for date checks in Edit Command" />

The above diagram shows that the checks are called by the EditCommand instead of the EditCommandParser.

This is admittedly a design flaw that will cause issues when new commands are added. As such, in future implementations, the checks should be done within the company class to ensure that companies cannot be created with dates that violate the constraints.


### Sort Feature

#### Implementation

The sort feature is facilitated by `Model` and `SortType` enum. The SortCommand is responsible for sorting the list of companies in the application based on the user's preference. The command supports three sorting types: alphabetical order, start date order, and end date order.

The `SortType` Enum has 3 values:
* `ALPHABETICAL_ASCENDING`: Sorts the companies alphanumerically.
* `STARTDATE_ASCENDING`: Sorts the companies by their starting date.
* `ENDDATE_ASCENDING`: Sorts the companies by their ending date.

`Sort` implements the following relevant operations:
* `model.sortCompanyListByName()` - Sorts `UniqueCompanyList` in `InternBook` in ascending alphanumerical order.
* `model.sortCompanyListByStartDate()` - Sorts `UniqueCompanyList` in `InternBook` in order of ascending start date.
* `model.sortCompanyListByEndDate()` - Sorts `UniqueCompanyList` in `InternBook` in order of ascending end date.

Given below is a step-by-step detailed guide on how the sort mechanism behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user inputs a command to sort the companies in the intern book in a specified order using the `sort` command.

Step 3. The `SortCommandParser` is responsible for processing user input. It takes the user's input and parses it into one of the three different `SortType` options available.

Step 4: A `SortCommand` object will then be called with the chosen `SortType` as the argument.

Step 5: `SortCommand#execute` is called, which calls the corresponding `model.sortCompanyList`

Step 6: The GUI will display the newly sorted company list.

The following activity diagram illustrates the workflow of the `SortCommand` feature:

<puml src="diagrams/SortCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activity diagram of SortCommand" />

The following sequence diagram shows how sort operation is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence diagram of SortCommand" />

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: Extensibility:**

Support for Future Enhancements:

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use a fixed set of sorting criteria (e.g., alphabetical order, start date order, end date order) implemented as switch cases within the SortCommand class.
    * Pros: Simplified implementation, straightforward to understand and maintain.
    * Cons: Limited flexibility for adding new sorting criteria in the future, may require modifications to the SortCommand class and switch cases if new sorting criteria are introduced.

* Alternative 2: Implement a more flexible sorting system using a strategy pattern, where each sorting criteria is encapsulated in its own class.
    * Pros: Improved extensibility, easier to add new sorting criteria without modifying existing code.
    * Cons: Increased complexity in implementation, potential overhead in managing multiple sorting strategy classes.

* Alternative 3: Introduce a dynamic sorting configuration where users can define custom sorting criteria through a configuration file or user interface.
    * Pros: Highly customizable, allows users to define sorting criteria based on their specific needs.
    * Cons: Increased complexity in implementation and management, potential challenges in ensuring user-friendly configuration interfaces.


### Mark/Unmark feature

#### Implementation

The mark/unmark mechanism is facilitated in two parts, the first by the `MarkCommandParser`, and then the `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` which extends the `Command` abstract class.
These commands allow users to mark and unmark companies, respectively, to keep track of their application status and interest.

Both commands interact with the Model and Company classes to update the application status of a company.

The following operations are implemented to support the Mark and Unmark feature:

* `ModelManager#markCompany(Company company)` â€” Updates the isMarked attribute of the specified Company object to true.
* `ModelManager#unmarkCompany(Company company)` â€” Updates the isMarked attribute of the specified Company object to false.
* `ModelManager#isCompanyMarked(Company company)` â€” Returns true if the specified Company object is marked, and false otherwise.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface and are used by the MarkCommand and UnmarkCommand classes to modify the application status of a company.
The `mark()` and `unmark()` methods in the Company class are also used to update the checkbox in the CompanyCard class to reflect the application status in the UI.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The ModelManager will be initialized with the initial intern book state.

Step 2. The user executes `mark 1` command to mark the 1st company in the InternBook.

Step 3. The `LogicManager` class will parse the user input and create a `MarkCommand` object with the index of the company to be marked.

Step 4. The `MarkCommand` class extracts the `Company` object at the specified index from the ModelManager.

Step 5. The `MarkCommand` class calls the `markCompany(Company company)` method of the ModelManager, passing the extracted `Company` object as a parameter.

Step 6. The `ModelManager` class updates the `isMarked` attribute of the specified `Company` object to `true`.

Step 7. The `CompanyCard` class updates the checkbox in the UI by using the method `checkboxIsMarked()` in the Company class to reflect the marked status of the company.

Step 8. The `ModelManager` class updates the filtered company list in the ModelManager to reflect the changes made to the `Company` object.

Step 9. The `MarkCommand` class returns a `CommandResult` object with a success message to the `LogicManager`.

Step 10. The `LogicManager` class updates the `ResultDisplay` in the UI with the success message.

The sequence diagram below shows how the MarkCommand executes the mark operation within the Logic component:

<puml src="diagrams/MarkSequenceDiagram.uml" width="550">

The activity diagram below summarizes the process of marking a company:

<puml src="diagrams/MarkActivityDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The Unmark feature follows a similar process, with the `UnmarkCommand` class calling the `unmarkCompany(Company company)` method of the ModelManager to update the `isMarked` attribute of the specified `Company` object to `false`.

#### Design considerations:
**Aspect: How mark/unmark executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a boolean attribute in the `Company` class to track the application status.
    * Pros: This approach keeps all company data within a single list, making it easier to manage and update the application status.
    * Cons: May not be suitable for more complex application status tracking requirements.
* **Alternative 2:** Uses a separate `Mark` class to track the application status.
    * Pros: Allows for more complex application status tracking requirements.
    * Cons: May require additional classes and methods to manage the application status, making it more complex to implement and maintain.

We chose Alternative 1 because it is simpler to implement and maintain, and meets the current requirements for tracking the application status of companies.



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternBook`. It extends `InternBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `internBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current intern book state in its history.
* `VersionedInternBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous intern book state from its history.
* `VersionedInternBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone intern book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternBook()`, `Model#undoInternBook()` and `Model#redoInternBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternBook` will be initialized with the initial intern book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single intern book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th company in the intern book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternBook()`, causing the modified state of the intern book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `internBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted intern book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/DBS â€¦â€‹` to add a new company. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInternBook()`, causing another modified intern book state to be saved into the `internBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInternBook()`, so the intern book state will not be saved into the `internBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the company was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous intern book state, and restores the intern book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial InternBook state, then there are no previous InternBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInternBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoInternBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the intern book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `internBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest intern book state, then there are no undone InternBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the intern book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternBook()`, `Model#undoInternBook()` or `Model#redoInternBook()`. Thus, the `internBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `internBookStateList`, all intern book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/DBS â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire intern book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the company being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.



### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed data archiving mechanism is facilitated by `ArchiveAddressBookStorage`. It implements `AddressBookStorage` with an option to store as `JSON` or `CSV`
* `ArchiveAddressBookStorage#StoreJSON()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current intern book in `JSON` format.
* `ArchiveAddressBookStorage#StoreCSV()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current intern book in `CSV` format.


These operations are exposed in the `Storage` interface as `Storage#StoreJSON()` and `Storage#StoreCSV()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the data archiving mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ArchiveAddressBookStorage` will be initialized with the initial intern book state.


Step 2. The user executes `Archive JSON` command to archive the active InternBook by calling the `Storage#StoreJSON()` method.

6. Should ensure the integrity of the data in the local storage files, with appropriate error handling to prevent
   data corruption.
7. A user should be able to export and import their data easily.
